//Module 02 Assignment - Crypto Libraries

//Instructions
//Develop a Java program that:
//imports one of the crypto libraries
//takes in keyboard text input
//generates and prints the MD5 hash of the keyboard text input

//we will be using the widely used Bouncy Castle library for this assignment
//Bouncy Castle is a collection of APIs used in cryptography. It is also the name of the company that developed it.



import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
import java.util.Scanner;

//we will have a seperate class for the main entry of the program
//this will allow us to keep the main entry of the program seperate from the actual logic of the program
//we will also use helper classes to keep the code clean and organized
// our helper class will be called CryptoHelper
//this class will contain the logic for generating the MD5 hash of the user input
